Should we separate them into different directories?\nOrganizing a growing set of components usually comes down to making it easy to:  \n• locate a component when you need to modify it,  \n• see which components belong together, and  \n• reduce clutter in a single directory.\n\nBelow are a few approaches you can consider for refactoring and reorganizing lib/wave_web/components:\n\n1) Group by Feature or Domain  \n   • If your app has distinct features (e.g., Dashboard, Profile, Settings), you might collect all related components for each feature under its own subdirectory.  \n   • Example structure:  \n       wave_web  \n       └── components  \n           ├── dashboard  \n           │   ├── dashboard_chart.dart  \n           │   └── dashboard_card.dart  \n           ├── profile  \n           │   ├── profile_header.dart  \n           │   └── profile_details.dart  \n           └── settings  \n               ├── settings_option.dart  \n               └── settings_toggle.dart  \n\n   This approach makes sense if your app is organized into distinct “modules” or “features” that rarely overlap in logic and UI.\n\n2) Group by Component Type  \n   • If your components are mostly “building blocks” across the entire app, you can group them by type (e.g., buttons, cards, forms).  \n   • Example structure:  \n       wave_web  \n       └── components  \n           ├── buttons  \n           │   ├── primary_button.dart  \n           │   └── secondary_button.dart  \n           ├── cards  \n           │   ├── info_card.dart  \n           │   └── product_card.dart  \n           ├── dialogs  \n           │   ├── confirmation_dialog.dart  \n           │   └── info_dialog.dart  \n           └── forms  \n               ├── text_field.dart  \n               └── login_form.dart  \n\n   This is often a good choice if you frequently reuse the same “type” of widget (like multiple variants of buttons or cards).\n\n3) Split Out “Common” or “Shared” Components  \n   • Some components are used everywhere (like a customized Button, TextField, or Spinner). You could move these into a shared folder to keep them separate from more specialized widgets.  \n   • Example structure (can be combined with either approach 1 or 2):  \n       wave_web  \n       ├── components  \n       │   ├── shared  \n       │   │   ├── primary_button.dart  \n       │   │   ├── secondary_button.dart  \n       │   │   └── common_dialog.dart  \n       │   ├── feature_a  \n       │   └── feature_b  \n       └── utils  \n\n4) Add an “index” (barrel) file if desired  \n   • If you find yourself importing multiple small files repeatedly, consider adding a barrel file (often named index.dart or simply the folder’s name) to re-export them.  \n   • This keeps imports shorter and more maintainable, especially when reorganizing later.\n\n5) Balance Granularity and Simplicity  \n   • Too many nested folders can be just as harmful as one big folder. Strike a balance so it’s still easy to navigate.  \n   • If a subdirectory only has one or two components, it might be overkill— consider merging small folders especially if they relate closely in functionality.\n\nIn summary:  \n• Yes, separating components into different directories can help if you have more than a handful in a single folder.  \n• Whether you group by feature or by type depends on your application structure, how your team works, and how you anticipate future changes.  \n• For maximum clarity, ensure that each folder’s contents are cohesive (they all belong to either the same feature or the same widget type).  \n\nBy applying one (or a blend) of these approaches, you can keep your lib/wave_web/components folder organized, making development and maintenance much smoother in the long run.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":334}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":32},"start":65,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":{"Error":"Failed to connect to API: 400 Bad Request {\"error\":{\"message\":\"The requested model is not supported.\",\"param\":\"model\",\"code\":\"model_not_supported\",\"type\":\"invalid_request_error\"}}\n"},"timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":335}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":33},"start":66,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":336}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":44},"start":67,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":{"Error":"Empty prompts aren't allowed.
